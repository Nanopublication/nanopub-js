[![Run tests and update docs](https://github.com/Nanopublication/nanopub-js/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Nanopublication/nanopub-js/actions/workflows/build.yml)

`nanopub-js` is a set of libraries to easily work with [Nanopublications](https://nanopub.net) in the browser with JavaScript. Packages are published under the `@nanopub` organization on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)

If you want to improve those libraries, please refer to the [contribute page](/pages/CONTRIBUTING.html) which details how to use the library in development.

This project is composed of multiple libraries that are still in development:

- [x] `@nanopub/utils`: Provide utilities to help fetch and load nanopubs, automatically extracting relevant information (e.g. URIs used for the different graphs)

- [x] `@nanopub/display`: Web components to help display the content of a nanopub, includes utilities to automatically generate CytoscapeJS configuration to visualize nanopubs as a network.

- [ ] `@nanopub/publish`: Utility to sign and publish nanopubs directly in the browser (not started yet).
